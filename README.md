# Personal Website

So, I was trying to think about a new design for my personal website [simonetavoletta.it](https://simonetavoletta.it) and stumbled upon [this one](https://www.christopherfujino.com/) while working on a Flutter app project and looking at GitHub issues in the official repo.

And I'm like: "I totally like this idea, let's ~~copy~~ take inspiration from that and do something similar."

So yeah, here it is.
